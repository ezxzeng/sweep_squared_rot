# Sweep Squared
## An autogenerated split 36 key keyboard

## Disclaimer

This is an early experimental prototype. Please do not rely on the autogenerated files and double check them manually
before sending them off to a PCB fab. The author and other random strangers on the internet have been able to produce
working keyboard prototypes from this repo; this does not mean that everything will work every time.

The author(s) waive(s) responsibility for any damage or regulatory violations caused by using this software (see

country.

A 5x3 split keyboard with 3 thumb keys. 

## Inspiration


- [bgkeeb](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/bgkeeb)
	- keyboard pcbs under 100mm x 100mm are cheap
- [cheapis](https://github.com/dotleon/cheapis)
	- sweeps can be rotated for more room and length between the thumb cluster and rest of the keys and still fit within 100mm x 100mm
- [samoklava](https://github.com/soundmonster/samoklava) and [ergogen](https://ergogen.cache.works/) to get keyboard layouts programatically
- [sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) and [swweeep](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/sweep36) for form factor and diode-less design
- [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58/tree/master)
	- key sockets can be hot swappable, reversible, and compatible with both mx and low profile switches
- [totem](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/totem)
	- sandwich case looks really slick and clean, and can also hide the controller parts that will be located under the palm

## Features

- 100mm x 100mm pcb for really cheap fabrication
- reversible footprint
- programatically generated with [ergogen](https://ergogen.cache.works/) (mostly)
- `footprints/key_switches.js` enables deciding between combinations of MX, Choc, or gateron low profile sockets
  > [!WARNING]  
  > still mostly untested, use at your own risk
- jst battery connector and 7-pin slider switch for battery management
- Same key routing as the [swweeep](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/sweep36)
- Can be both wired and wireless while maintaining a diodless design
  - Features a toggle button to change whether p0 directs to TRRS or the inner thumb key
  - This does mean that the wired version would only support two thumb keys

## Other considerations
- this design does not support LEDs or displays
- pads for gateron low profile hotswap sockets gets cut off by the holes a little: this may or may not be problematic
- [samoklava's](https://github.com/soundmonster/samoklava) auto routing does not really work here
- Still being tested, use at your own risk


## Rendering and generation

Ergogen:
```bash
ergogen -d .
```
Get board image renderings (also done in the [generation](https://github.com/ezxzeng/sweep_squared_rot/actions/workflows/manual_route.yml) workflow):
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/kikit --entrypoint pcbdraw yaqwsx/kikit:v1.3.0-v7  plot --style set-white-enig.json routed_pcb/board.kicad_pcb images/board-front.png

docker run -v $(pwd):/kikit --entrypoint pcbdraw yaqwsx/kikit:v1.3.0-v7  plot --style set-white-enig.json --side back routed_pcb/board.kicad_pcb images/board-back.png
```
